I began learning to code with Python and creating games with Pygame. Some of my current skills include React, Javascript and Next.js. As well as this, my background as a pharmacist has provided me with valuable skills such as attention to detail, adaptability and critical thinking, which are essential in software development where technologies are constantly evolving.</p>
